## Setup

- Neovim
- Oh-My-Tmux
- Oh-My-Zsh

### Neovim

Two symlinks must be created in place of the local Neovim configuration paths:

- first is the configuration entrypoint
- second is the module folder with source code

```shell
ln -s <root-path>/dotfiles/nvim/init.lua ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
ln -s <root-path>/dotfiles/nvim/lua/TheAltF4Stream ~/.config/nvim/lua/TheAltF4Stream
```

Once both symlinks are created install all plugins with `:PackerSync` in Neovim.

#### Keymaps

To find keymaps for any given plugin check the module file for it in `./nvim/lua/TheAltF4Stream/plugins`.

### Oh-My-Tmux

One symlinks must be created in place of the local `oh-my-tmux` configuration paths:

```shell
ln -s <root-path>/dotfiles/oh-my-tmux/.tmux.conf.local ~/.tmux.conf.local
```

### Oh-My-Zsh

One symlink must be created in place of the local `oh-my-zsh` configuration paths:

```shell
ln -s <root-path>/dotfiles/oh-my-zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```
